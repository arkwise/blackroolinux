INSTALL
*******
Extract the package and copy the entire uClinux/ folder to PSP/GAME. Then copy
the kernel image and pspboot.conf to uClinux/ as well and run it in XMB. The
pre-built version of the kernel image can also be found on my website.


REVISIONS
*********
   v0.22 - Redesigned a way of entering the kernel mode eliminating the risk
           of overwriting of the running prx code during kernel RAM transfer,
           and fixed a couple of other bugs as well.
   v0.21 - Bug fixing primarily.
   v0.20(slim) - Ported to slim psp by danzel. Great thanks to danzel!
   v0.20 - Became configurable through a config file and was released along
           with kernel v0.2.
   v0.10 - Prototyping
