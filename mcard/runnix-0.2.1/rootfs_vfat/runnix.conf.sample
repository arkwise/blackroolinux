# Sample runnix (http://www.runnix.org) configuration file

# Use this as a sample for your .run images

# Variables to read (DO NOT SET THESE)
# $BASE - The location where runnix is mounted
# $ROOT - The location where your .run is mounted
#
# Variables to set

# Kernel command line
# This is the command line runnix will pass to kexec
# for your linux kernel
# Like GRUB or any other bootloader, it can be any
# option that is valid for your linux kernel
# (kernel to be booted from your .run, most likely)
KCMD="root=/dev/ram0 rw init=/linuxrc astlinux=geni586 astimg=trunk.run astkd=/dev/sda1 astlive ide=nodma"

# Offset for root filesystem
# If your filesystem is a hard disk image with a full
# partition table and traditional bootloader, you can
# have losetup skip past the bootloader and partition
# table to find a filesystem. "32256" will usually
# find the beginning of the first partition.
# If undefined, runnix will not use an offset (default)
# OFFSET="32256"

# The location of the kernel runnix will boot
# Can be any path accesible by runnix
# If the kernel is in the runnix partition (rare), use $BASE
# If the kernel is inside the .run file, use $ROOT
KERN="$ROOT/boot/bzImage"

# root fs type - can be anything supported by runnix kernel
# If undefined, runnix will try everything - NOT RECOMMENDED
FSTYPE="ext2"

# The location of the initrd runnix will use with your $KERN
# Can be any path accesible by runnix
# If the initrd is in the runnix partition, use $BASE
# If the initrd is inside the .run file (rare), use $ROOT
INITRD="$BASE/os/initrd.img"
