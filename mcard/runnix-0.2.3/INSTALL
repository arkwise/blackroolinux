# RUNNIX 0.1
# I don't write good docs (anymore) - Kristian Kielhofner <kris@krisk.org>

To install:

create a fat 16 filesystem on something:
NOTE: syslinux does not seem to like dos volume names
don't specify -N when running mkdosfs

mkdosfs -F 16 /dev/something1

install syslinux on it:

./syslinux /dev/something1
cat mbr.bin > /dev/something

mount it:

mount /dev/something1 /mnt/runnix

copy runnix to it:

cp -R rootfs_vfat/* /mnt/runnix/

Now all you have to do is get an image!

AstLinux is currently the only image available, but I will be working
on more soon.

All you should have to do is put a .run file (and its config file and other
stuff) in /mnt/runnix/os/

If you are not using a serial console, take a look at the various 
syslinux.cfg files in /mnt/runnix

Have fun!
